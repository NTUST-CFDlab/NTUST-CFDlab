In Taiwan Tech CFD lab, we have developed two in-house, finite volume-based solvers: Tiger-F and Tiger-C. These solvers are used to model fluid-structure interactions (FSI). Tiger-F is written in the FORTRAN programming language, while Tiger-C is developed using object-oriented C++. Both solvers employ the direct-forcing immersed boundary (DFIB) method to simulate FSI, along with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for modeling turbulent flow. The lab is also progressing developing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), utilizing recent technology advancements, GPU resources in collaboration to the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC) to apply neural network in the field of computational fluid dynamics. The Tiger-C solver is parallelized using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) to distribute the computational load across multiple cores, optimizing performance on multi-core processors. In contrast, the Tiger-F solver utilizes a hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach for CPU-based computations, and a hybrid OpenACC/MPI approach for GPU-based computations. As both solvers are efficiently parallelized, they significantly reduce computational time while maintaining high numerical accuracy.
